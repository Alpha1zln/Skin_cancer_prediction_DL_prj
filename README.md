Project in College - Using DL - ANN, CNN, KOH_NN, . 
ML DL LAB - PROJECT IN COLLEGE - 4TH SEM. 


Skin cancer is among the most prevalent and potentially fatal types of cancer, with its rates steadily increasing worldwide. Early detection and accurate classification are crucial for improving patient outcomes and reducing mortality. 

This project focuses on using (ML) and (DL) techniques to improve the detection and classification of skin cancer. It emphasizes Melanoma, Basal Cell Carcinoma, and Squamous Cell Carcinoma, some of the most hazardous forms of skin cancer. 

The project utilizes various neural network architectures to analyze images of skin lesions, enabling early diagnosis and classification.

Technologies Used
ML (ANN)
DL: (CNN) 
Prog Lang: Python
Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras
Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Outcome:
Developed multiple models to classify skin cancer from images of skin lesions. 
The ANN achieved a 70.53% accuracy, while the CNN reached 76.74%, demonstrating the effectiveness of deep learning in identifying complex visual patterns. 

2ND YR - LAB PROJ DL ML LAB - UNDER LAB INCHRG.

Role
Model development, and evaluation. Designed and tested the ANN and CNN models. 
Tried MobileNet [faced some issues] 
Also studied in Research papers about advanced models like Kohonen Neural Networks (Self-Organizing Maps), Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), that are being experimented for better result and high accuracy in detection.

Impact : 
The results suggest that ML and DL can play a crucial role in improving early detection and classification of skin cancer. The project provides a basis for further integrating these techniques into clinical practice, offering dermatologists more robust tools for diagnosis and decision-making.
